# Preface {.unnumbered}

This Quarto book contains all tutorials created by the Section of Epidemiology. It is deployed from the repository [R-tutorials](https://github.com/NorwegianVeterinaryInstitute/R-tutorials) through git backed deployment. You can add more tutorials to this book by cloning this repository and following these steps:

::: callout-note
The main branch of the repository has "soft protection" enabled. It is recommended to create a new branch to make any changes and then merging the changes with the main branch after testing to make sure everything renders correctly.
:::

1.  Create your tutorial as a QUARTO document in *html* format.

2.  Add your `tutorial_name.qmd` file to this project folder.

3.  Add your tutorial to the `_quarto.yml` file.

4.  Run `rsconnect::writeManifest()` to update the manifest file.

5.  Commit the changes and push to the repository.

6.  Wait for the deployment to trigger automatically or manually trigger deployment by clicking on the **Update Now** button under **Info** on the [content page](https://connect.posit.vetinst.no/R-and-posit-tutorials/).

::: callout-important
This QUARTO book only contains tutorials. There is a lot more documentation (such as Official Posit User Guides, Guides ad How-Tos) in [documentation](https://github.com/NorwegianVeterinaryInstitute/posit-team/wiki/Documentation) under the posit-team repository.

::: callout-note
When you create a new session in Workbench, you are creating a RStudio Pro Session. Hence, all the tutorials under the section **R/RStudio tutorials** will be applicable both on Workbench as well as RStudio on your personal computers (unless stated otherwise in the individual chapters).
